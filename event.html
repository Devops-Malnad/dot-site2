                    The event .Bytes was successfully organized by the DevOps Team during the odd semester on the 3rd
                    and 4th of November 2017. The event truly embodied the tagline, "Where Technology Meets Fun," as
                    it creatively blended technical challenges with engaging activities, making technology both
                    accessible and enjoyable for all participants
                    The event offered the team members valuable hands-on experience with software tools essential for
                    application development, greatly enhancing their technical expertise. This not only inspired the
                    students of MCE but also fostered a culture of innovation and creativity on campus.

                    challenged participants with puzzles and problem-solving tasks rooted in coding and logic, while
                    Phat Anthaheli brought a playful, competitive edge, pushing participants to think outside the box
                    and apply their technical knowledge in novel ways. The success of .Bytes demonstrated the power of
